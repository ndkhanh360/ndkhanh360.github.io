title: "Uncertainty-aware Label Distribution Learning for Facial Expression Recognition"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ldlva
excerpt: 'Despite significant progress over the past few years, ambiguity
is still a key challenge in Facial Expression Recognition
(FER). It can lead to noisy and inconsistent annotation,
which hinders the performance of deep learning models
in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new
uncertainty-aware label distribution learning method to improve
the robustness of deep models against uncertainty and
ambiguity. We leverage neighborhood information in the
valence-arousal space to adaptively construct emotion distributions
for training samples. We also consider the uncertainty
of provided labels when incorporating them into the
label distributions. Our method can be easily integrated
into a deep network to obtain more training supervision
and improve recognition accuracy. Intensive experiments
on several datasets under various noisy and ambiguous settings
show that our method achieves competitive results and
outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches.'
