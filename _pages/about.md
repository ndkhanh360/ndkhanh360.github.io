I'm a recent graduate from VNUHCM-University of Science, majoring in Information Technology. I was honored to be the salutatorian of the Honor Program (cohort 2017) of the Faculty of Information Technology, one of the best IT/CS programs in Vietnam.

I'm currently a teaching assistant at the Department of Computer Science, VNUHCM-University of Science. I'm also an AI Resident at FSoft AI Center, working on equivariant models for graphs and point clouds. Previously, I was a research intern at VinAI Research, where I learned about vision & language research as well as scene text recognition. 

My research interests include computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. I am actively looking for a M.Sc./Ph.D. position in Computer Science!
