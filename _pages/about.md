I'm a recent graduate from VNUHCM-University of Science, majoring in Information Technology. I was honored to be the salutatorian of the Honor Program (cohort 2017) of the Faculty of Information Technology, one of the best IT/CS programs in Vietnam.

I'm currently a teaching assistant at the Department of Computer Science, VNUHCM-University of Science. I'm also an AI Resident at FSoft AI Center, working on equivariant models for graphs and point clouds. Previously, I was a research intern at VinAI Research, where I learned about vision & language research as well as scene text recognition. 

My main research interests include computer vision and deep learning, with applications in scene understanding and tracking, 3D reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. However, I am always open to exploring and working on other exciting research areas!
